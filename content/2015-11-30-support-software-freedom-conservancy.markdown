The [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/) are desperately looking for financial support after one of their corporate supporters have stopped their sponsorship. This week, there's an anonymous pledge to match donations from new supporters.

Becoming an SFC supporter will help them fight for our software freedom. I have signed up for a monthly donation, and I suggest you do so too [here](https://sfconservancy.org/supporter/).

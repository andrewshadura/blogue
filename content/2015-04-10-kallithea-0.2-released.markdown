<small>This post is almost a carbon copy of the Kallithea 0.2 release notes.</small>

[Kallithea project](https://kallithea-scm.org/) have just released Kallithea 0.2. Kallithea is a Python-based GPLv3 source
code management software for web-based hosting of Mercurial and Git repositories.

This release brings many changes since 0.1. Notably, pull requests system
have been improved, making contributing changes more robust. The visual
appearance has also been refined: modern font-based symbolic icons from
FontAwesome and GitHub Octicons have replaced the previously used bitmap
icons, and revision graphs are now drawn with HiDPI display support.
Kallithea now supports Mercurial 3.3 and Dulwich 0.9.9. Several fixes in
the database code boosted performance significantly.

We have also updated our Javascript libraries: jQuery, CodeMirror and Mergely.
Javascript and CSS code have been cleaned up, with less and less code depending
on Yahoo UI library.

Since 0.1 we have discovered two security issues, so all users are strongly
recommended to upgrade. For more details on these issues, please see our
[Security Notices page](https://kallithea-scm.org/security/)

For more information, see [https://kallithea-scm.org/](https://kallithea-scm.org/) or

 * pullrequests: don't add repo owner as reviewer in all PRs

As the maintainer of [GNU indent][1], I have just released [version 2.2.12][2] ([signature][3]), the first release GNU indent saw in eight years.

Highlights include:

* New options:
    * `-pal` / `--pointer-align-left and `-par` / `--pointer-align-right`
    * `-fnc` / `--fix-nested-comment`
    * `-gts` / `--gettext-strings`
    * `-slc` / `--single-line-conditionals`
    * `-as` / `--align-with-spaces`
    * `-ut` / `--use-tabs`
    * `-nut` / `--no-tabs`
    * `-sar` / `--spaces-around-initializers`
    * `-ntac` / `--dont-tab-align-comments`
* C99 and C11 keywords and `typeof` are now recognised.
* `-linux` preset now includes `-nbs`.
* `-kr` preset now includes `-par`.
* Lots of bug fixes

I’d like to thank all of the contributors of this release, most importantly:

* [Tim Hentenaar](http://hentenaar.com/) for all of the fixes and refactoring he’s done in his branch
* [Petr Písař](http://xpisar.wz.cz/), who maintains GNU indent in Red Hat and its derivatives, who’s submitted a lot of fixes and kept supporting users on the mailing list when I couldn’t
* Santiago Vila, who maintains GNU indent in Debian
* Daniel P. Valentine, who helped me a lot when I initially took over the maintenance of GNU indent
* And [lots of others](https://hg.savannah.gnu.org/hgweb/indent/) who submitted their patches

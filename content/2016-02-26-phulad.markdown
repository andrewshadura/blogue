If you bought an North India travel guide by Vanessa Betts and Victoria
McCulloch, and tried to figure out where is ‘Phulud’ and how to get there
from Deogarh (and how to get to Deogarh itself from Udaipur), don’t waste your
time googling, as **it’s not Phulud, but [Phulad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phulad).**

It does seem that the narrow gauge journey from Deogarh to Phulad is indeed beautiful:

Meanwhile, I have also found this very interesting post by Mary Anne Erickson: [Impressions of India: Udaipur to Deogarh](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mary-anne-erickson/impressions-of-india-udai_b_6827462.html). I’m not yet sure we’re going to follow that route, but it seems promising.

P.S. Despite what the guide said about the airport in Jaisalmer, which is *due to open in 2013*, according to the reports, it is [still](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaisalmer_Airport) [not open](http://www.businessinsider.com/take-a-look-inside-indias-brand-new-ghost-airport-2015-8), so we have to skip that city. Oh well.

**EDIT**: The guide actually also says, on page 10: *Fly from Jaisalmer back to Delhi to connect with your flight home.* Fact checking? No, who needs that? :)

Recenly I've decided to register at Sixxs to be able to use IPv6 at my new
location as they seem to use tunnelling protocol which bypasses NAT, so that
was exactly what I needed. I'm a long time HE.NET user, so I expected the same
quality of service and ease of use. I went to their website and filled in the
registration form.

Soon I got the reply: 'User Rejected'

<pre>
The reason specified was:
  Either give full valid information or don't signup, see http://www.sixxs.net/faq/account/?faq=address
</pre>

I replied, 'I'm sorry, in which part the information wasn't complete or valid?'

Their reply was:

<pre>
We where unable to verify the address in combination with your name.
Please provide full proper and valid details.
</pre>

Well, as I've already done that, I've sent them it again, carefully putting
diacritics where needed:

<pre>
> We where unable to verify the address in combination with your name.  

How do you verify that?

> Please provide full proper and valid details.  

My current address is: ..... ####/##, ### ## ......, ......... The
mobile phone is +4.. ... ... .... And that's exactly the information I
provided you with, it's full, proper, correct and valid.

It appears to be completely lacking any respect to treat everyone this
way as if I were a malicious person or something :(

They replied:

<pre>
> How do you verify that?  

By asking your local government if the information is valid.

That is not the information you provided.

I would state it the other way around in that when one does not provide
full valid details one is doing that to us.

Conversation continues:

Nonsense, you provided:

..... ####/##
.......
........

That does not contain the zip code you supplied above.

Clearly you are not providing full valid details.
Nevertheless, our check was correct.

You don't deserve anything as you are wasting our time and resources.

Is it always like that or am I missing something?

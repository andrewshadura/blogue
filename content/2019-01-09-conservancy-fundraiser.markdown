The [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/) is having the last 7 days to collect the remaining less than $14 000 of the fundraiser generously matched by [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/). All donations up to $90 000 will be matched until 15 January.

Conservancy is an organisation sponsoring nearly 50 free software projects helping them, most importantly with accounting, paying developers and defending their trademarks and ensuring license compliance.

![Conservancy is currently home to almost fifty member projects](https://sfconservancy.org/img/member-project-logos.png)

Read more about what the Conservancy does on [their website](https://sfconservancy.org/supporter/). The matching funds expire soon, so if you can, please donate directly before 15 January.

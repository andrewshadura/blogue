I’ve always loved train journeys, but with *flygskam* changing people’s travel preferences across Europe
(and possibly worldwide, though probably not that much), I decided to take train to [FOSDEM][] this time.

When I first went to FOSDEM which, just in case you don’t know, happens each February in Brussels at [ULB][],
I flew with Ryanair from Bratislava to Charleroi because it was cheaper. After repeating the same journey
a couple of times and I once nearly missed the last bus coach to Brussels because of a late flight, and decided to
rather pay more but travel with more comfort to Brussels Zaventem, the main airport of Brussels. It’s well-connected
with Brussels, trains run fast and run often, which is a significant upgrade in comparison to Charleroi,
where the options were limited to bus coaches and a slow train connection from Charleroi the town.

As some of my readers may know, my backpack was stolen from me after FOSDEM two years ago, and with it
were gone, among other things, my passport and my residence permit card. With my flight home having been
planned two and half hours from the moment when I realised my things are gone, I couldn’t get a replacement
travel document quickly enough from the embassy, so I had to stay at my friends in Vilvoorde (thanks a lot again,
Jurgen!) and travel with the cheapest ground transportation I could find. In my case, it was a night RegioJet coach
to Prague with a connection to (again) RegioJet train to Bratislava. (I couldn’t fly even though I already had my
temporary travel document since I might need to somehow prove that I’m allowed to be in the Schengen zone, which
is difficult to do without a valid residence permit.) Sleeping on a bus isn’t the best way to travel for long
distances, and I was knackered when I finally dropped on my sofa in Bratislava next morning. However, what I
learnt was that it was possible, and were it a bit more comfortable, I wouldn’t mind something like this again.

Here I must admit that I’ve travelled by long-distance trains quite a fair bit: in my childhood we went by train to summer holidays
to [Eupatoria][] in Crimea and [Obzor][] in Bulgaria (through [Varna][]). Both journeys took days, and the latter also involved a long
process of changing the bogies on the Moldovan-Romanian border (Giurgiulești/Galați). Since I moved to Slovakia, I many times took
the night train from Minsk to Warsaw with a connection to Bratislava or Žilina, a journey which usually takes at least 18 hours.
Which is to say, I’m not exactly new to this mode of travel.

With the Austrian railway company [ÖBB][] expaning their night train services as a part of their Nightjet brand,
the [Vienna to Brussels sleeper returned to service last week][GraunSleeper]. Prices are still a bit higher than I would have
preferred (at the time of me writing this, ticket in a compartment with 6 *couchettes* start at €79, but it’s not
as bad as it could be (apparently the last minute price is more than €200). Anyway, when I decided to go to Brussels
by train, this service didn’t exist yet, so instead I followed the very useful tips from the [Man in the Seat 61][] and
booked a day-time connection: Bratislava to Vienna to Frankfurt to Brussels.

|      | Bratislava hl.st.     | 20:22   |           |        |

I’ve booked two through tickets since in this case the *Super Sparschiene* discount offered lower prices than normally an international
return ticket would offer. For some reason neither [ZSSK][] (Slovak railways) nor [ÖBB][] offered ticket online (or for a comparable
price in a ticket office anyway), so I booked online with *[Deutsche Bahn][]* for €59.90 each way. This sort of ticket, while bookable online,
had to be *posted* for a €5.90 extra.

Since I’m staying the first night at friend’s in Vilvoorde again, I also had buy a ticket for this small stretch of the track from the Belgian railways
directly.

See you at FOSDEM!

It turnes out moving to a different city takes more time and 
effort than I originally expected, so I'm skipping FOSDEM this 
year. That's unlike I originally planned to spend the beginning 
of February — I had my flight booked already, but apparently that's
not the best idea ever to go travelling right in the middle of
relocation :)

I'd like to bring some attention to activity of a person mostly known as Bohdan Zograf. If you Google that name, you'll find that he seems to be a person who knows Belarusian language very well, and is interested in translating as many texts as he can into Belarusian for no money. Unfortunately, he isn't. Trust me, I'm really a native speaker, I was born in Minsk, Belarus, and have lived there for 25 years of my life (at least this person: ([1](http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0xC61A895E85EE3E0E), [2](http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x798F1E35CB4D38A9)) may prove I really am the person I'm telling you I am, if you're interested). Said that, I think I really have a right to say: those translations are fake. These texts are just machine-translated versions of the original articles or web pages, published in some strange weblog at some strange web site without being structured or systematised. This already [has been](http://advogato.org/person/redi/diary/242.html) pointed out by [Jonathan Wakely](http://advogato.org/person/redi/), but, well, some people may not believe him as he doesn't seem to know Belarusian.

Anyway, one more interesting detail: why would a person with a non-Belarusian name and [a Hungarian telephone number](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator/2011Apr/0008.html) who can't really properly spell the name of the country (Belarus, not Belorussia) and the language (Belarusian, not Belorussian — well, lots of people do that mistake, I must admit), say that Belarusian is his mother tongue do a translation asking to link him back for that? Doesn't that seem strange a bit? It does for me.

I don't really understand the reasons behind that, and I can't really see what is
he going to achieve by doing this, but, as Jonathan said, I believe that *all
spammers must die.* Well, not necessarily literally, but at least they must stop
spamming, shouldn't they?

**Bohdan Zograf is a spammer.** Don't do what he asks you to do, as doing so you
help spammers.

P.S. Spread the word.

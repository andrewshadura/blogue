Before the pandemic started last year, I planned to use the last months of my then-expiring UK visa and go to England by train. I‚Äôve completed two train long journeys by that time already, to [Brussels](/2020/02/21/fosdem-by-train-followup/) and to Belarus and Ukraine, but this would be something quite different, as I wanted to have multiple stops on my way, use night trains where it made sense, and to go through the Channel Tunnel.

The Channel Tunnel fascinated me since my childhood; I first read about it in the Soviet *Science and Life* magazine (*–ù–∞—É–∫–∞ –∏ –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å*) when I was seven. I‚Äôve never had the chance to use it though, since to board any train going though it I‚Äôd first need to get to France, Belgium or the Netherlands, making it significantly more expensive than the cheap ‚Ç¨30 Ryanair flights to Stansted.

As the coronavirus spread across the world, all of my travel plans along with plans for a sabbatical had to be cancelled. During 2020, I only managed to go on two weekend trips to Prague and Budapest, followed by a two-weeks holiday on Crete (we returned just a couple of weeks before the infection numbers rose and lockdowns started). I do realise that a lot of people couldn‚Äôt even have this much because the situation in their countries was much worse ‚Äî we were lucky to have had at least some travel.

Fast forward to August 2021, I‚Äôm fully vaccinated, I ‚Äî once again ‚Äî have a UK visa for five years, and the UK finally recognises the EU vaccination passports ‚Äî yay! I can finally go to Devon to see my mother and sister again. By train, of course.

Compared to my original plan, this journey will be different: about the same or even more expensive than I originally planned, but shorter and with fewer stops on the way. My original plan would be to take multiple trains from Bratislava to France or Belgium and complete this segment of the trip in about three days, enjoying my stay in a couple of cities on the way. Instead, I‚Äôm taking a direct NightJet from Vienna to Brussels, not stopping anywhere on the way.

Since I was booking my trip just two weeks ahead, the price of the ticket is not that I hoped for, but much higher: ‚Ç¨109 for the ticket itself and ‚Ç¨60 for the berth (advance bookings could be about twice as cheap).

Next, to London! Eurostar is still on a very much reduced schedule, running one train only from Amsterdam through Brussels and Lille to London each day. This means, of course, higher ticket prices (I paid about ‚Ç¨100 for the ticket) and longer waiting time in Brussels ‚Äî my sleeper arrives about 10 am, but the Eurostar train is scheduled to depart at 3 pm.

The train makes a stop in Lille, which I initially suspected to be risky as at the time when I booked my tickets, as at the time France was on the *amber plus* list for the UK, requiring a quarantine upon arrival. However, [Eurostar announced](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/07/17/eurostar-passengers-travelling-france-segregated/) that they will assign travellers from Lille to a different carriage to avoid other passengers having to go to quarantine, but recently France was [taken off the *amber plus* list](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-amber-and-green-list-rules-for-entering-england#amber-list).

The train fare system in the UK is something I don‚Äôt quite understand, as sometimes split tickets are cheaper, sometimes they‚Äôre expensive, sometimes prices for the same service at different times can be vastly different, *off-peak* tickets don‚Äôt say what exactly *off-peak* means (very few people in the UK are asked were able to tell me when exactly *off-peak* hours are). Curiously, transfers between train stations using London Underground services can be included into railway tickets, but some last mile connection like Exeter to Honiton cannot (but this used to be possible). Both [GWR.com](https://www.gwr.com/) and TrainLine refused to sell me a single ticket from London to Honiton through Exeter, insisting I split the ticket at Exeter St Davids or take the slower South Western train to Honiton via Salisbury and Yeovil. I ended up buying a ¬£57 ticket from Paddington to Exeter St Davids with the first segment being the London Underground from St Pancras, and a separate ¬£7.70 ticket to Honiton.
